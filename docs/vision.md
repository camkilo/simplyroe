Realm of Echoes is an **ever-evolving fantasy simulation** built on real chemistry.  
Players experiment with elemental combinations to discover materials, tools, and even classes.  
Every action has permanence — discoveries are logged, the map evolves, and history remembers.

We’re building not just a game, but an **emergent universe** where imagination and science merge.
