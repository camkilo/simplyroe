# Vision

**Realm of Echoes** is a **living web service** where every player shapes a shared world through AI-driven creation, conversation, and emergent meta-gameplay.

## Core Philosophy

This isn't just a game—it's an **ever-evolving fantasy simulation** where:
- Players craft content through AI-powered generation
- NPCs are generative collaborators, not static quest-givers
- Social systems turn human creativity into shareable moments
- Every creation carries provenance and lineage

## What Makes It Next-Gen

### 1. Generative Collaborators
NPCs that:
- Write their own dialogue dynamically
- Adapt to player personality
- Generate quests based on world state
- Emulate player speech patterns over time

### 2. Player-Owned Content Economy
- Every creation tracked with UUID + lineage tree
- Attribution across all remixes
- Reputation currency based on impact
- Discovery through community curation, not algorithms

### 3. Remixability
- One-click remix/share of any NPC, quest, or asset
- Full lineage metadata for credit
- Derivative creations amplify original creator reputation
- Organic content evolution through community iteration

### 4. Micro-Sessions
- 2-10 minute gameplay loops
- Mobile/web optimized
- Designed for viral sharing
- Persistent impact despite short sessions

## Core Player Loops

### 1. Create
Players prompt/generate:
- NPCs with personalities and backstories
- Quests with branching narratives
- Items and cosmetics
- World lore and locations

### 2. Play / Explore
- Join rooms for short encounters
- Interact with generated NPCs
- Experience other players' creations
- Contribute to emergent narratives

### 3. Iterate
- Refine creations based on feedback
- Remix others' content with modifications
- Trade and collaborate
- Build reputation through quality

### 4. Share & Compete
- Content voting and curation
- "Most remixed" leaderboards
- Weekly community challenges
- Social media integration

## Technical Vision

Built with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI for speed and scalability
- **Generative**: Local LLM integration (llama.cpp / GGML)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket + Redis pub/sub
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for canonical state
- **Deployment**: Self-hosted inference, static frontend

## Current State

**MVP Implemented:**
- ✅ NPC generation with AI-ready templates
- ✅ Full provenance and lineage tracking
- ✅ Social sharing with OG images
- ✅ Room-based play sessions
- ✅ Leaderboard and reputation system
- ✅ Authentication and user profiles

**Coming Next:**
- 🚧 Local LLM integration for dynamic dialogue
- 🚧 Real-time WebSocket updates
- 🚧 Quest generation system
- 🚧 Asset/cosmetic generation
- 🚧 Voice chat and collaboration tools

## The Ultimate Goal

Create a living, breathing world where:
- **Every player is a creator**
- **Every NPC has agency**
- **Every action has legacy**
- **Community shapes reality**

This is more than a game—it's an **emergent universe** where imagination and technology merge to create something entirely new.
